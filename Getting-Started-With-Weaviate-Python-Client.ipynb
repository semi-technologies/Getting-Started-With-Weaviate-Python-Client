    "Weaviate is an open-source, cloud-native, modular, real-time vector search engine. It is build to scale your machine learning models. Because Weaviate is modular, you can use it with any machine learning model that does data encoding. Weaviate comes with optional modules for text, image, and other other media types, that can be chose based on your task and data. Also, one could use more than one module, depending on the variety of data. More information [here](https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/current/).\n",

    "In this articles we are going to use the _text_ module to see the most important functionalities and capabilities of Weaviate. The text module, also called _text2vec-contextionary_, captures the semantic meaning of the text objects and places it a concept hyper-space. This allows to do semantic search, in contrast to 'word matching search' that other search engines do.\n",
